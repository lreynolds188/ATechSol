GrapheneOS is a privacy and security focused mobile operating system recommended by Edward Snowden. Based off the Android Open Source Project, it removes all 3rd party and affiliated applications, services, and bloatware while simultaneously hardening the privacy and security of the remaining operating system, open source software, and utilities. Currently only available for Pixel devices.
