Brave is a new web browser built on Chromium's open source platform that utilizes blockchain technology. It features its own adblock, tracking protection,  and synchronization of preferences, passwords, bookmarks, etc via blockchain. As well as the option to opt-in and receive brave ads to earn Basic Attention Token's (BAT) a form of crypto-currency. 

This project shows great promise though there still is some refinement to be done as far as rewards functionality goes but the rest of the browser is fast, functional, and privacy conscious. Additionally they are currently in a testing phase for their own privacy based search engine.
