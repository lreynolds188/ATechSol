Brave is a new web browser built on Chromium's open source platform and utilizes blockchain technology. It features it's own adblock and tracking protection, synchronization of preferences, passwords, etc via blockchain, as well as the option to opt-in to view brave ads and earn Basic Attention Token's (BAT) a form of crypto-currency. This project shows great prospects but still has some development to go as far as full ad reward functionality goes but the rest of the browser is fast, functional, and privacy conscious. Additionally they are currently in a testing phase for their own search engine.
