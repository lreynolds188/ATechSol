Brave is a new web browser built on Chromium's open source platform that utilizes blockchain technology. Available on all desktop and mobile devices it features its own adblock, tracking protection, and synchronisation of preferences, passwords, bookmarks, etc. They also offer the option to opt-in to receive Brave ads and earn Basic Attention Token's a form of crypto-currency. 

This project shows great promise though there are still some issues to be resolved as far as the rewards functionality goes. Despite this temporary limitation the browser remains fast, functional, and privacy conscious.
