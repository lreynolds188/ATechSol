Signal is an open source end-to-end encrypted messaging service. Available on all desktop and mobile devices it includes all of the features we come to love from a messaging service in todays modern era such as text, call, and video as well as gifs, emoticons, group meetings, and much more.

To setup Signal you must provide your mobile number which is used as an identifier for sending and receiving messages and calls between contacts. From there all messages, calls, and video is encrypted using a key on the device and transported through an internet connection ensuring only the sender and receiver can access the contents of a conversation.

Messages are only encrypted between Signal to Signal users; A message or call made through Signal to a non Signal phone number will not be encrypted.
