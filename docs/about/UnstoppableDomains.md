UnstoppableDomains is a blockchain based domain registrar. They are the first of their kind and currently offer .crypto and .zil domains. Their domains have a one off purchase fee and are integrated into the Ethereum blockchain. Domains can be securely stored in your Ethereum wallet however there is a gas fee (currently high) required to transfer a domain.

Crypto wallet addresses can be added to the domains record which will allow diverting of funds through the domain simplifying those long and pesky wallet addresses. Alteration to a domains structure can then be made through the UnstoppableDomains portal and costs an Ethereum gas fee to modify the record on the chain.
