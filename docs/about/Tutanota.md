Tutanota is a German based open source end-to-end encrypted emailing service. They are the second largest provider of privacy based emailing and offer all the services you'd come to expect like custom domains, alias', encrypted calendar/contacts, and much more at a respectable price.

Note: Emails are only automatically encrypted between Tutanota users; You will be required to agree on and set an encryption key with any parties you wish to email confidentially that do not also utilise Tutanota as their emailing service.
