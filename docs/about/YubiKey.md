YubiKey is a hardware authentication device developed by Yubico. It serves to protect access to computers, networks, and online services that support one-time passwords. Hardware-based keys are significantly more secure than SMS or software based options. Software-based keys are vulnerable to SIM-swapping and other attacks that hardware-based keys can overcome.
