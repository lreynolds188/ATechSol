The Ledger Nano is the best hardware wallet currently on the market. They offer 2 separate models the X and S. The model X is a fully featured bluetooth enabled hardware wallet that can be loaded up with all the application wallets for your different crypto assets. From there it can be disconnected from your phone and held in cold storage (offline mode/no internet) so if your systems are compromised your tokens still be secure. The model S has the same functionality but fewer features and storage space as well as requiring a wired connection to interact with assets.
