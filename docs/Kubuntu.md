Kubuntu is a flavour of Ubuntu which is build on Debian Linux's Open Source platform. It features Plasma instead of Ubuntu's traditional Gnome interface. I personally find this prefferable as it provides far more customisability and is much more Windows user friendly. It still retains Ubuntu's ease of application installation and large support infrastructure.
