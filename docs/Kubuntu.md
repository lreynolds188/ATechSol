Kubuntu is a great option for desktop operating systems. It is a flavour of Ubuntu which is build on Debian Linux's Open Source platform. It features Plasma instead of Ubuntu's traditional Gnome desktop interface. I personally find this prefferable as it allows for far more customisability and is very Windows user friendly. It still retains Ubuntu's ease of application installation and large support infrastructure.
