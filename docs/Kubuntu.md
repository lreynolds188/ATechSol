Kubuntu is a great choice for an open source desktop operating system. It is a flavour of Ubuntu which is built on Debian Linux's Open Source platform. It features Plasma instead of Ubuntu's traditional Gnome desktop interface. We recommend this over Ubuntu only as it allows for more customisability and is very Windows user friendly. It still retains Ubuntu's ease of application installation and large support infrastructure.
