We remove unnecessary steps in processes by automating your home and/or business environment with the use of custom built Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. These devices can be as large or as small as needed to suit the project's needs.

An IoT device is a computer device that can be outfitted with sensors, switches, and actuators, connected to the internet, and serves some purpose. 

This could be something as simple as turning a light switch on and off via a mobile device or as complex as utilizing radio frequencies, receiving sensor data, and controlling valves. 

If you have machinery or a manual process in need of automation please feel free to contact us [here](contact.md).
